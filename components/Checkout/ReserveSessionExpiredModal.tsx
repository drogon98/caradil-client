          Ooops! It seems your session to reserve this car has expired and
          another user has already booked this car. Due to booking
          competitiveness this might happen when it takes you longer to book a
          car. By default, each guest has 20 mins to book a car after which the
          car is published back to the public.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Worry not, we have other cars like this one. Try to spend the 20 mins
          reservation time wisely to effect your booking successfully. Thank you
        </p>
