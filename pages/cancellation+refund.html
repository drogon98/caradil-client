<h3><strong>Guest cancellation</strong></h3>
<p>
  Guests may cancel their trip through our site, and the cancellation is
  effective immediately. Whether the guest received a full refund, a partial
  refund, or receives no refund depends on the circumstances. The total amount
  refunded will depend on when the guest cancels the trip.

  booking. Guests may cancel free of charge within 24hrs after booking if the
  trip is scheduled to start after 24hrs from booking time. If a guest wants to
  cancel a confirmed trip, we encourage them to notify their host as soon as
  possible via Caradil messaging and to process the cancellation themselves

<p>Trip modifications</p>
<p>
  If a guest requests a trip modification and the host accepts, that
  modification does not reset the free cancellation period for the trip. It
  remains tied to the original booking time.

<p>Cancellations outside the free period</p>
<p>
  If a guest wants to cancel a confirmed trip, we encourage them to notify the
  host via Caradil messaging as soon as possible and to process the cancellation
  themselves through the Caradil website. We’ll issue a partial refund to guests
  who cancel in this manner and do not fall within the free cancellation period.
  If a trip is cancelled and it is less 24hrs long, we will refund the guest the
  trip fee minus the For canceled trips that are longer than two days, we’ll
  refund the guest the trip price and trip fee minus the average of one day's
  cost, the protection plan, any Extras, any young driver fee, and half of any
  delivery fee. For canceled trips that are two days or shorter, we’ll refund
  the guest the trip price and trip fee minus half the average of one day's
  cost, the protection plan, any Extras, any young driver fee, and half of any
  delivery fee.
</p>

<p>Guest no-show</p>
<p>
  If a guest fails to cancel and doesn't show up for the trip within 30 minutes
  of the trip's scheduled start time, it's a guest no-show. If a guest has
  booked a trip in a Caradil Go car, has not canceled their trip, and does not
  show up for 12 hours after the trip’s scheduled start time, it’s a guest
  no-show. A guest who shows up to a trip with no license, with an invalid
  license, or who sends their additional driver in their place is also a guest
  no-show. Caradil or the host will cancel guest no-show trips, and we’ll issue
  the guest a partial refund. For no-show trips that are longer than two days,
  we’ll refund the guest their trip price and trip fee minus the average of two
  days' cost, the protection plan, any Extras, any young driver fee, and half of
  any delivery fee. For no-show trips that are two days or shorter, we’ll refund
  the guest their trip price and trip fee minus the average of 75% of one day's
  cost, the protection plan, any Extras, any young driver fee, and half of any
  delivery fee.

</h3>
<p>Guest trips canceled by host and host no-shows</p>
<p>
  On occasion, a host might cancel a guest’s trip or fail to show up at trip
  start. If a host cancels a guest’s trip or has not canceled and doesn’t show
  up for the trip within 30 minutes of the scheduled start time, it’s a host
  no-show, and the guest will receive a full refund. Funds from the canceled or
  no-show trip will be available for 24 hours after the cancellation to be used
  to rebook a trip. After 24 hours, we’ll automatically issue a full refund.
  Guests who don’t want to rebook and don’t want to wait 24 hours for Caradil to
  issue a refund can follow the instructions in the cancellation email to
  initiate their refund.
</p>
<p>Trips canceled by Caradil</p>
<p>
  In some cases, Caradil’s trust and safety team will cancel a guest’s booked
  trip. If that were to happen, Caradil will contact the guest and host, and the
  guest will receive a full refund.
</p>
<h3>
  <strong
    >Guest trips impacted by flight delays, flight cancellations, or lost
    baggage</strong
  >
</h3>
<p>Flight delays or flight cancellations</p>
<p>
  If a guest’s flight is delayed or canceled, they must message their host to
  tell them and to request a trip modification for a new start time. If the host
  cannot or does not accommodate a new start time and the trip must be canceled,
  Caradil will issue the guest a full refund if they've message their host and
  provided documentation. Specifically, guests must notify the host of the
  flight delay or cancellation at least one hour before the scheduled Caradil
  trip start time. They must provide documentation, such as a screenshot from
  the airline mobile app or website, that shows the flight issue. The guest must
  notify Caradil of a flight delay or cancellation within at least 24 hours of
  the trip’s scheduled start time to be eligible to benefit from this
  cancellation policy. If the guest’s flight is canceled/delayed more than three
  days in advance of the trip start time, this policy does not apply.
</p>
<p>Lost baggage delays</p>
<p>
  If the guest experiences a lost baggage delay, Caradil will issue the guest a
  full refund if they’ve messaged their host and provided documentation.
  Specifically, they must notify their host no later 30 minutes after the
  scheduled trip start time, notify Caradil of the lost baggage delay within 24
  hours, and provide photo evidence of a baggage issue.
</p>
<h3><strong>Host cancellation</strong></h3>
<p>
  If a host wants to cancel a booked trip, we encourage them to notify the guest
  via Caradil messaging as soon as possible. Then they must process the
  cancellation through the Caradil website or app. The cancellation is effective
  immediately, and the guest receives a complete refund. See&nbsp;<a

</p>
<h3><strong>Host cancellation and host no-shows</strong></h3>
<p>Host cancellations</p>
<p>
  Hosts will be subject to a $50* fee if they cancel a trip less than 24 hours
  before the start of the trip. If they cancel more than 24 hours before the
  start of the trip, the fee is $25*. After each canceled trip, hosts receive an
  automated review on their vehicle listing. It mentions the cancellation and
  how far in advance they canceled the trip. We waive the host fee and review if
  the guest rebooks a new trip with the same host within 24 hours of the
  cancellation. Hosts who repeatedly cancel trips may be subject to additional
  penalties, including removal from the marketplace.
</p>
<p>All-Star Hosts</p>
<p>
  If you're an All-Star Host at the time of cancellation, we'll waive the
  cancellation fee. Hosts will still receive an automated cancellation review on
  their public profile but can respond to the review to explain why the
  cancellation was necessary. Cancellations will still impact host performance
  metrics, so frequent cancellations could result in loss of All-Star status.
</p>
<p>Host no-shows</p>
<p>
  If a host fails to cancel and doesn't show up for the trip within 30 minutes
  of the trip's scheduled start time, it's a host no-show. Hosts who fail to
  show up for a trip are subject to a $150* fee.

  If a guest fails to cancel and doesn't show up for the trip within 30 minutes
  of the trip's scheduled start time, it’s a guest no-show. If a guest has

  show up for 12 hours after the trip’s scheduled start time, it’s a guest
  no-show. A guest who shows up to a trip with no license, with an invalid
  license, or who sends their additional driver in their place is also a guest
  no-show.
</p>
<p>Conditions</p>
<p>
  Hosts must report all no-shows within 72 hours of the trip start. If a guest
  tells us that they didn't show up and you didn't report the no-show to us, we
  won't issue you earnings for that trip. We may also charge a fine.

  When Caradil must cancel a trip less than 24 hours before trip start due to a
  guest verification issue, the host will be paid in line with the terms of the
  table above. If the Caradil cancellation is made more than 24 hours before the
  trip start or within one hour of booking for trips that were booked less than
  25 hours before trip start, the host will not be eligible for earnings.

    >Host trips impacted by guest flight delay, flight cancellation, or lost
    baggage.</strong

</h3>
<p>
  If a guest’s flight is delayed or canceled or they experience a lost baggage
  delay, they must message their host to inform them and to request a trip
  modification for a new start time. We expect the host to make a good-faith
  effort to accommodate a new trip start time. The host must document their
  attempt to accommodate a new trip start time in Caradil messaging. If the host
  cannot or does not accommodate a new start time and the trip must be canceled,
  the host will not receive any host earnings for the trip. In the event the
  host makes a good faith attempt to reschedule the trip, but both guest and
  host are unable to agree on a satisfactory trip modification and the trip must
  be canceled, Caradil will pay the host earnings as though it were a guest
  no-show. (See table above.)
