            Caradil and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Caradil”, “we”, or
            “us”), provide an online car sharing platform that connects vehicle
            owners with travelers, locals and tourists seeking to book those
            vehicles. Caradil is accessible online at&nbsp;

            The Caradil websites, blog and associated services are collectively
            referred to as “the Services”. By accessing or using the Services,
            including by communicating with us or other Caradil users, you agree
            to comply with, and be legally bound by, the provisions of these
            Terms of Service (these “Terms”), whether or not you become a
            registered user of the Services. These Terms govern your access to
            and use of the Services and constitute a binding legal agreement
            between you and Caradil.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Modification.</strong>&nbsp;Caradil reserves the right, at
            our sole discretion, to modify the Services or to modify the
            Agreement, including these Terms, at any time. If we modify these
            Terms, we will post the modification on the Services. If you
            continue to access or use the Services after we have posted a
            modification or have provided you with notice of a modification, you
            are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified terms. If
            the modified terms are not acceptable to you, your sole recourse is
            to stop using and accessing the Services and close your Caradil
            Account within 30 days. If you choose to close your Caradil Account,
            the previous effective version of these Terms will apply to you,
            unless you use the Services during the intervening 30 day period, in
            which case the new version of these Terms will apply to you.

            <strong>Eligibility, registration, verification</strong>
          </h3>
          <h4>Eligibility</h4>
          <p>
            The Services are intended solely for persons who are 18. Any use of
            the Services by anyone that does not meet these age requirements is
            expressly prohibited.
          </p>
          <h4>Registration</h4>
          <p>
            To access certain features of the Services, you must sign up for an
            account with us (a “Caradil Account”). You can create a Caradil
            Account by providing us your first and last name, email address, and
            creating a password. When you book a vehicle as a traveler or guest
            (“guest”), you provide us with certain additional information about
            yourself. Similarly, when you list a vehicle as a vehicle owner or
            host (“host”), you provide us with certain additional information
            about yourself and your vehicle(s) (if applicable). You must provide
            accurate, current, and complete information during the registration,
            booking, and/or listing process. You must keep your Caradil Account
            up to date at all times.
          </p>
          <h4>Verification</h4>
          <p>
            Where permitted, Caradil has the right, but not the obligation, to
            undertake screenings, checks, and engage in processes designed to
            (1) help verify the identities or check the backgrounds of users,
            including driving history and driver’s license validity and (2)
            verify vehicle details. Caradil does not endorse any vehicle, user,
            or a user’s background, or commit to undertake any specific
            screening process. Caradil may in its sole discretion use
            third-party services to verify the information you provide to us and
            to obtain additional related information and corrections where
            applicable, and you hereby authorize Caradil to request, receive,
            use, and store such information. Caradil may permit or refuse your
            request to book or list a vehicle in its sole and absolute
            discretion. Caradil may, but does not commit to, undertake efforts
            to ensure the safety of vehicles shared through the Services. We do
            not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse the safety,
            roadworthiness, or legal status of any vehicles beyond our policies
            that require hosts to ensure their vehicles are in safe and operable
            condition, legally registered to be driven on public roads.

            will be itemized at checkout for guests. You can verify the amount
            for your trip at checkout before you submit your trip request. Hosts
            can view earnings on the Host Dashboard. When you provide Caradil a
            payment method, you authorize Caradil, or third-party service
            providers acting on behalf of Caradil, to store your payment

          <h3>
            <strong>Specific terms for hosts</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            The following sections also apply if you share your vehicle through
            the Services:
          </p>
          <h4>Host commitments</h4>
          <p>
            As a host, you commit that you will provide a safe and legally
            registered and insured vehicle, with current license plates, with a
            clean (non-salvage/branded/written off) title, and in good
            mechanical condition. You will provide such vehicle on time but only
            to a guest who is listed on the Services. You commit that your
            listings will be complete and accurate and you will honor all
            representations made in your listings, including honoring the price
            quoted to a guest. You will not cancel a booking for the purpose of
            seeking a higher price from a guest. You will not offer any vehicle
            or optional Extra that you do not yourself own or have authority to
            share or that may not be shared for compensation pursuant to the
            terms and conditions of any agreement with a third party, including,
            but not limited to, a lease or financing agreement. You will not
            offer any Extra that is not safe, clean, and acceptable for the use
            it is intended. You will not offer any vehicle that is the subject
            of a missing or stolen vehicle report. You will not offer any
            vehicle that is the subject of a safety recall without first
            properly addressing the matter subject to the recall. You will not
            offer a vehicle that is not roadworthy (i.e., not “street legal”) in
            the location where it is shared and it will not have any illegal
            modifications to any part of the vehicle. You will remove any
            firearms or other weapons from your vehicle prior to providing it to
            a guest. You will repay loans related to your Caradil business on
            time and in full.
          </p>
          <h4>Information given at registration</h4>
          <p>
            When you sign up for Caradil, you will identify passenger vehicle(s)
            that you want to list for sharing through the Services. You may only
            use the Services in connection with vehicles that you own or
            otherwise have all the necessary rights and permissions to share for
            compensation.
          </p>

          <h4>Caradil photography</h4>
          <p>
            Caradil may offer hosts the option of having photographers take
            photographs of their vehicles and/or hosts with their vehicles
            (“Images”). You alone are responsible for using the Images in
            connection with your Caradil listing and you agree that you will
            cease using the Images if they no longer accurately represent your
            vehicle. You agree that Caradil is the sole and exclusive owner - or
            exclusive licensee, as allowed by applicable law - of all right,
            title, and interest in all copyrights, trademark rights, and any and
            all other intellectual property rights, including right of
            publicity, worldwide, in the Images regardless of whether you
            include them in your listing, and you shall take no action to
            challenge or object to the validity of such rights or Caradil’s
            ownership or registration thereof. You acknowledge that Caradil may
            use the Images for advertising, marketing, commercial, and other
            business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to
            your listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation.
            Further, you waive any and all rights to royalties or moral rights
            you may have in the Images. If you use the Caradil photography
            program, you agree that you will not use the Images in connection
            with sharing your vehicle on any platform, website, or application
            other than Caradil. At Caradil’s request, you will execute documents
            and take such further acts as Caradil may reasonably request to
            assist Caradil to acquire, perfect, and maintain its intellectual
            property rights and other legal protection in the Images.
          </p>
          <h4>Vehicle availability</h4>
          <p>
            Once a trip is booked, you must make the vehicle available or
            deliver the vehicle as expected by the guest.
          </p>
          <h4>Pricing, earnings, and payments</h4>
          <p>
            You will have the ability to set and revise the vehicle’s pricing as
            you choose. Caradil will pay you the amount collected from guests
            that book your vehicle, less the applicable fees payable to Caradil.
          </p>

          <h4>Maintenance</h4>
          <p>
            You are required to regularly check your vehicle for any defects in
            its operations or safety. You promise that, at all times, your
            vehicle will be in safe and roadworthy condition, in good mechanical
            condition, and in full compliance with all applicable inspection and
            registration requirements. You will only list vehicles with a clean,
            non-salvaged, non-written off, non-washed, and non-branded title.
            You agree to respond to any applicable recall or similar safety
            notices and to complete any recommended action before allowing your
            vehicle to be booked. In addition, if Caradil believes that your
            vehicle does not conform to reasonable standards, Caradil may notify
            you and reserves the right to remove or decline listing your vehicle
            until its concerns have been resolved. Caradil may, but does not
            commit to, undertake efforts to ensure the safety of vehicles booked
            through the Services.
          </p>

          <h3>
            <strong>General provisions</strong>
          </h3>
          <h4>Termination</h4>
          <p>
            You may discontinue your use of the Services at any time and Caradil
            may terminate your access to the Services and remove any listings
            for any reason or no reason to the extent permissible under
            applicable law. Termination of access to the Services will not
            release a Party from any obligations it incurred prior to the
            termination and Caradil may retain and continue to use any
            information, including but not limited to photography, previously
            provided by you. Termination of the Agreement will not have any
            effect on the disclaimers, waiver or liability limitations, or legal
            disputes provisions under the Agreement and/or any fees due, and all
            of those terms will survive any termination of the Agreement.
          </p>
          <h4>No vehicle transfer or assignment</h4>
          <p>
            Except as otherwise provided herein, guests and hosts agree that
            nothing in these Terms constitutes an actual or purported transfer
            or assignment of any right or interest in a vehicle or optional
            Extras shared through the Services.
          </p>
          <h4>Disclaimers</h4>

          <h4>Not a rental car business</h4>
          <p>
            Caradil is not a rental car business. It does not own a fleet of
            vehicles, and is not in the business of renting vehicles to the
            public. Caradil provides an online platform where vehicle owners and
            those in need of a vehicle can meet and share vehicles amongst
            themselves subject to these Terms.
          </p>
          <h4>Rounding off</h4>
          <p>
            Caradil may, in its sole discretion, round up or down amounts that
            are payable from or to hosts or guests to the nearest whole
            functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to
            the nearest kenyan shilling or dollar ) unless explicitly prohibited
            under applicable law.
          </p>

          {/* <h4>Translations</h4>
          <p>
            Where Caradil has provided you with a translation of the English
            language version of these Terms or any Policies, in case of any
            wording discrepancies between the English and any other versions of
            the Terms and any Policies, the English language wording takes
            precedence.
