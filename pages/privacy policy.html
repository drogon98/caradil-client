<h3><strong>Personal information we collect</strong></h3>
<p>
  We collect three categories of personal information - personal information you
  give us; personal information automatically collected from your use of the
  Services; and personal information from third-party sources.
</p>
<h4>Personal information you give us</h4>

  we require certain personal information to open your account, such as your
  name, email address, and password.

  profile information to use certain features of the Services which may include
  street addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license number, date of issuance and
  issuing country and/or state, profile photos, employer, city, school,
  biography, and date of birth. Certain parts of your profile (like your profile
  photos, employer, city, school, and biography) are part of your public profile
  page and will be publicly visible to others.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Vehicle data</strong>. We collect information you provide in relation
  to a vehicle such as vehicle listing details, vehicle identification number
  (VIN), availability dates, reviews, and uploaded trip photos.
</p>
<p>

  account or payment card numbers, and transaction information in connection
  with a potential or actual transaction, which may be processed and stored by
  one or more third party payment service providers or digital payments
  companies.

  identity verification information such as a photograph or scanned copy of a
  driver’s license, passport, national ID card, or payment card, last four
  digits of your Social Security number, social insurance number, social media
  account information, driver’s/motor vehicle record, insurance information, or
  other forms of identification information. Where we request that you withhold
  certain information (such as obscuring or redacting aspects of identification
  information), please do so. To learn more, visit our Help Center article

  <strong>Communications</strong>. When you communicate with Caradil, including
  via phone, email, or chat, or use the Services to communicate with other
  users, we collect information about your communication and any information you
  choose to provide.
</p>
<h4>Personal information we automatically collect.</h4>

  we may collect information about your approximate location (e.g., city/town
  associated with your IP address). When you opt in to use our location sharing
  feature, we may collect the precise location information of your mobile
  device. Keep in mind that most mobile devices allow you to control or disable
  the use of location services by any application on your mobile device in the
  device’s settings menu.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Device data</strong>. We collect information about your computer or
  mobile device, such as its operating system type and version number,

  device identifiers, or general location information such as city, state, or
  geographic area.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Trip data</strong>. We collect transactional information related to
  the trips you take through the Services, including the date and time of your
  trip, amounts charged, and other related trip details.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>In-vehicle device data</strong>. If a vehicle is enrolled in a Caradil
  Go program or has a Caradil Go device installed, we may remotely collect
  certain information about the vehicle. Depending on the make, model, and year
  of the vehicle, this information may include, GPS location, car battery
  voltage, fuel level, odometer reading, malfunction indicator lamp (e.g., a
  check engine light), door state (e.g., locked/unlocked), engine state (e.g.,

  tags, e-tags, “Flash cookies”, or other local storage provided by your browser
  or associated applications (collectively “Cookies”). For more detailed
  information on our use of these technologies, please see our policy on&nbsp;<a

</p>
<h4>Personal information we collect from third-party sources.</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Third-party services</strong>. If you choose to log in to our Services
  through a third-party site or service (e.g., Apple, Facebook, or Google), the
  third-party service may send us information such as your registration and
  profile information from that service. The information we may receive varies
  by service and is controlled by the relevant service. By associating an
  account managed by a third party with your Caradil account and authorizing
  Caradil to have access to this information, you agree that Caradil may
  collect, store, and use this information in accordance with this Privacy
  Policy. We are not responsible for how those third parties use and share your
  information. Please refer to the privacy policies of those third parties to
  understand how they use and share your personal information.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Third-party in-vehicle devices</strong>. If your vehicle, or a vehicle
  you book through the Services, includes an in-vehicle device or system
  operated by a third-party service (including vehicle manufacturers) or
  installed by the host, that host or service may record information about your
  use of the car. These devices or systems may monitor the car's condition,
  performance and operation, track fuel consumption, distance traveled,
  location, and other information. The host and/or third-party service will be
  solely responsible for its use of such information but may disclose such
  information to Caradil, which we will use in accordance with this Privacy
  Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Background check services</strong>. To the extent permitted by
  applicable laws, Caradil may collect background information about you from
  public records, background check providers, or other screening services,
  including credit reports and information about criminal convictions or from
  sex offender registries. We may use your information, including your full name
  and date of birth, to obtain such reports.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Other sources</strong>. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we
  may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, fraud
  detection information, or data from credit bureaus and other third-party data
  providers.
</p>
<p>
  We may combine the information about you that we receive from third-party
  sources with other information we have about you.

<h4>To comply with law:</h4>
<p>
  We use your personal information as we believe necessary or appropriate to
  comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal processes, such as to
  respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities.
</p>
<h4>With your consent:</h4>
<p>
  In some cases, we may specifically ask for your consent to process your
  personal information.
</p>
<p>
  We may also use your personal information as described elsewhere in this
  Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.
</p>
<h3><strong>How we disclose your personal information</strong></h3>
<h4>With your consent</h4>
<p>We may share your information at your direction or with your consent.</p>
<h4>Profiles, listings, and other public information</h4>
<p>
  Your public listing page on the Services will always include some basic
  information, such as your user ID or name associated with your account, your
  public profile photo, and for hosts, the city where your car is located, your
  listing description, your calendar availability, transaction related
  information to allow our community to evaluate your reliability and
  responsiveness, and reviews or feedback about you. Your public listing page
  may also include aggregate demand information (such as number of page views
  over a period of time) and information about your cancellations. The Services
  may also display the approximate geographic pick-up location of your vehicle.
</p>
<p>
  The Services allow your public profile and public listing pages to be included
  in search engines, in which case your public profile and public listing pages
  may be indexed by search engines and may be published as search results.
</p>
<h4>Sharing between hosts and guests</h4>
<p>
  Caradil enables car owners to offer and share their vehicles with other
  individuals. If you agree to a booking through the Services, we may provide
  your information to the other party in that transaction as reasonably
  necessary to facilitate the transaction. For example, Caradil may provide your
  mobile phone number to facilitate communication, your driver's license
  information to confirm license validity, or your photograph to facilitate
  identification. We will also share the address of the vehicle and, if
  applicable, the proposed delivery location with the other party. If you used
  the Trip Photo feature, we may share the trip photos you upload and associated
  captions with the other party. The other party may also send you text messages
  (such as to confirm pickup or delivery location).&nbsp;<a

  >
</p>
<h4>Service providers</h4>
<p>
  We may share information with vendors and service providers who support the
  operation of the Services and business and who need access to such information
  to carry out their work for us (including, for example, web hosting,
  analytics, payment processing, email delivery, marketing, insurance, claims
  administration, and customer support services). In some cases, the service
  provider may directly collect the information from you on our behalf. For
  hosts who choose to use our photography program, your contact information will
  be shared with the photographer assigned to shoot your vehicle. These service
  providers may use your personal information only as directed or authorized by
  us.
</p>
<h4>Third-party platforms and social media networks</h4>
<p>
  If you have enabled features or functionality that connect the Services to a
  third-party platform or social media network (such as by logging in to the
  Services using your account with the third party, providing your API key or
  similar access token for the Services to a third party, or otherwise linking
  your Services account to a third-party’s services), we may disclose to the
  third-party platform or social media network the personal information
  necessary to facilitate the connection or that you authorized us to share. We
  do not control the third party’s use of your personal information.
</p>
<h4>Professional advisors</h4>
<p>
  We may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as
  lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers, where necessary in the course of the
  professional services that they render to us.
</p>

<p>
  We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our business or
  assets, including your personal information, in connection with a business
  transaction (or potential business transaction) such as a corporate
  divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of
  assets, or in the event of bankruptcy or dissolution.
</p>
<h4>
  Responding to legal requests, preventing harm, and protecting our rights
</h4>
<p>
  We may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement,
  governmental or tax authorities, or third parties. We will make such
  disclosure to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by applicable
  law or where we consider such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply
  with our legal obligations or legal process, to respond to claims asserted
  against us, and&nbsp;<a
    href="https://Caradil.com/us/en/policies/privacy#for-security-and-safety"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >for the security and safety purposes</a
  >&nbsp;described above. We may also disclose your information in response to
  valid legal requests relating to criminal investigations or alleged or
  suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose Caradil, you,
  or any other user, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
  Caradil, our users, or others.
</p>
<p>
  We may also disclose your personal information as described elsewhere in this
  Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.
</p>

<h4>Interest-based advertising choices</h4>
<p>
  Your choices for limiting use of your personal information for interest-based
  advertising include:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Blocking cookies in your browser.</strong>&nbsp;Most browsers let you
  remove or reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based
  advertising. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings.
  Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. For
  more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been

<p>
  <strong>Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings.</strong
  >&nbsp;Your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of
  the advertising ID associated with your mobile device (e.g., Apple ID for
  Advertising or Google Advertising ID) for interest-based advertising purposes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Using privacy plug-ins or browsers.</strong>&nbsp;You can block sites
  from setting cookies for interest-based ads by using a browser with privacy
  features, like Brave, or installing browser plugins like Privacy Badger,
  Ghostery, or uBlock Origin, and configuring them to block third party
  cookies/trackers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Advertising industry opt-out tools.</strong>&nbsp;You can also use
  these opt-out options to limit use of your information for interest-based

<h4>Choosing not to share your personal information</h4>
<p>
  Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we
  need your personal information in order to provide the Services to you, if you
  do not provide this information when requested (or we later delete it at your
  request), we may not be able to provide you with the Services.
</p>
<h4>Third-party platforms and social media networks</h4>
<p>
  If you choose to connect the Services to a third-party platform or social
  media network, such as by using the third party’s authentication service to
  log into your account on the Services, you may be able to control your
  settings through the third-party platform or social media network. If you
  withdraw our ability to access certain information from a third-party platform
  or social media network, that choice will not apply to information that we
  have already received from that third party.
</p>
<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
<p>
  We employ a number of technical, physical, and organizational measures
  designed to protect information against unauthorized access, destruction, or
  alteration while it is under our control. However, no method of transmitting
  or storing information can be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the security
  of your personal information.
</p>
<h3><strong>Other important information</strong></h3>
<h4>Cross border transfer</h4>
<p>
  The Services are controlled and operated from the United States. Your personal
  information may be used, stored, and processed in any country where we have
  facilities or in which we engage service providers. These locations may be
  outside of your state, province, or country of residence, and may have
  different and/or less protective data protection rules than those of your
  state, province, or country. As a result, this information may be subject to
  access requests from governments, courts, regulatory agencies, security
  authorities, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to the laws
  in those jurisdictions.
</p>
<h4>Sensitive information</h4>
<p>
  We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive information
  (e.g., Social Security numbers, social insurance numbers, passports,
  information related to racial or ethnic origin, or health) on or through the
  Services or otherwise to us unless specifically requested.
</p>
<h4>Children</h4>
<p>
  The Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18 and we do not
  knowingly collect personal information from users under the age of 18. If a
  child under the age of 18 has already provided us with personal information,
  his or her parent or guardian may contact us to request that we delete it.
</p>
<h4>Third-party privacy practices</h4>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information
  collected by Caradil. This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not
  responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third
  parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the
  Services link. The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply
  endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. If you
  disclose your information to others, or if you are directed to a third-party
  website, their privacy notices and practices will apply.
</p>
<h4>Translations</h4>
<p>
  Where Caradil has provided you with a version of this Privacy Policy in a
  language other than English, in case of any wording discrepancies between such
  version and the English version, the English wording takes precedence.
</p>
<h3><strong>Changes to this privacy policy</strong></h3>
<p>
  We may change this Privacy Policy. Please take a look at the “Last revised”
  legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last
  revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post
  the revised Privacy Policy on the Services or as otherwise indicated. Your use
  of the Services following these changes means that you accept the revised
  Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree to these changes, you can contact us to
  close your account.

<h3><strong>Information for California residents</strong></h3>
<p>
  <strong>Scope.</strong>&nbsp;This section applies only to California residents
  entitled to receive the information in this section under the California
  Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("<strong>CCPA</strong>"). It describes how we
  collect, use, and share Personal Information of California residents when we
  act as a "business" as defined under the CCPA, and their rights with respect
  to their Personal Information. For purposes of this section, "<strong
    >Personal Information</strong
  >" has the meaning given in the CCPA but does not include information excluded
  from the scope of the CCPA. In some cases, we may provide a different privacy
  notice to certain categories of California residents, such as job applicants,
  in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.

  isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
