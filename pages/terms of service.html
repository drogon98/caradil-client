  <strong><span class="ql-cursor">﻿</span>Introduction</strong>
</h3>
<p>
  Caradil Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Caradil”, “we”, or “us”),
  provide an online car sharing platform that connects vehicle owners with
  travelers and locals seeking to book those vehicles. Caradil is accessible
  online including at&nbsp;<a
    href="https://Caradil.com/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >Caradil.com</a
  >&nbsp;and as an application for mobile devices. The Caradil websites, blog,
  mobile applications, and associated services are collectively referred to as
  “the Services”. By accessing or using the Services, including by communicating
  with us or other Caradil users, you agree to comply with, and be legally bound
  by, the provisions of these Terms of Service (these “Terms”), whether or not
  you become a registered user of the Services. These Terms govern your access
  to and use of the Services and constitute a binding legal agreement between
  you and Caradil.
</p>
<p>
  These Terms, together with the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://Caradil.com/policies/privacy"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >Caradil Privacy Policy</a
  >, applicable insurance terms and certificates, roadside assistance terms, and
  the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://Caradil.com/us/en/policies/additional-policies"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >Additional policies</a
  >&nbsp;(together, the “Policies”) constitute the “Agreement” between you and
  Caradil (each a “Party” and together, “the Parties”).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Modification.</strong>&nbsp;Caradil reserves the right, at our sole
  discretion, to modify the Services or to modify the Agreement, including these
  Terms, at any time. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on
  the Services. We will also update the “Last Revised” date at the top of these
  Terms. If you continue to access or use the Services after we have posted a
  modification or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are
  indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified terms. If the modified
  terms are not acceptable to you, your sole recourse is to stop using and
  accessing the Services and close your Caradil Account within 30 days. If you
  choose to close your Caradil Account, the previous effective version of these
  Terms will apply to you, unless you use the Services during the intervening 30
  day period, in which case the new version of these Terms will apply to you.
</p>
<h3><strong>Eligibility, registration, verification</strong></h3>
<h4>Eligibility</h4>
<p>
  The Services are intended solely for persons who are 21 or older, except in
  the United States where we permit guests age 18 and older to book vehicles.
  Any use of the Services by anyone that does not meet these age requirements is
  expressly prohibited.
</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>
  To access certain features of the Services, you must sign up for an account
  with us (a “Caradil Account”). You can create a Caradil Account by providing
  us your first and last name, email address, and creating a password or
  connecting through an account with a third-party site or service (including
  Apple, Facebook, and Google). When you book a vehicle as a traveler or guest
  (“guest”), you provide us with certain additional information about yourself.
  Similarly, when you list a vehicle as a vehicle owner or host (“host”), you
  provide us with certain additional information about yourself and your
  vehicle(s) (if applicable). You must provide accurate, current, and complete
  information during the registration, booking, and/or listing process. You must
  keep your Caradil Account up to date at all times. Based on information you
  provide, Caradil may impose additional requirements for you to book a trip
  (e.g., providing a deposit, adding a second form of payment, buying a certain
  level of protection plan, or other requirements). To fight spam and abuse of
  the Services, Caradil has implemented reCAPTCHA Enterprise, and your use of
  reCAPTCHA is subject to a separate&nbsp;<a

    rel="noopener noreferrer"

    >Privacy Policy</a
  >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a
    href="https://policies.google.com/terms"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >Terms of Use</a
  >.
</p>
<h4>Verification</h4>
<p>
  Where permitted, Caradil has the right, but not the obligation, to undertake
  screenings, checks, and engage in processes designed to (1) help verify the
  identities or check the backgrounds of users, including driving history and
  driver’s license validity and (2) verify vehicle details. Caradil does not
  endorse any vehicle, user, or a user’s background, or commit to undertake any
  specific screening process. Caradil may in its sole discretion use third-party
  services to verify the information you provide to us and to obtain additional
  related information and corrections where applicable, and you hereby authorize
  Caradil to request, receive, use, and store such information. Caradil may
  permit or refuse your request to book or list a vehicle in its sole and
  absolute discretion. Caradil may, but does not commit to, undertake efforts to
  ensure the safety of vehicles shared through the Services. We do not make any
  representations about, confirm, or endorse the safety, roadworthiness, or
  legal status of any vehicles beyond our policies that require hosts to ensure
  their vehicles are in safe and operable condition, legally registered to be
  driven on public roads, have a clean title (e.g.,
  non-salvaged/non-branded/non-washed/non-written off), not subject to any
  applicable safety recalls, and otherwise satisfy our&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/articles/203991940"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >eligibility requirements</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Consumer Report Authorization.</strong>&nbsp;When you attempt to book
  or list a vehicle, or at any time after where Caradil reasonably believes
  there may be an increased level of risk associated with your Caradil Account,
  you hereby provide Caradil with written instructions and authorize Caradil, in
  accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, applicable consumer reporting
  laws, or any similar laws to obtain your personal and/or business auto
  insurance score, credit report, and/or conduct a background check, including a
  criminal background check where permissible under applicable law.
</p>
<h3><strong>Fees, taxes</strong></h3>
<h4>Fees</h4>
<p>
  The fees we charge for using the Services and other cost structures will be
  itemized at checkout for guests. You can verify the amount for your trip at
  checkout before you submit your trip request. Hosts can view earnings on the
  Host Hub and learn more about earnings breakdown&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/en-us/articles/203992000-Earnings-and-payment"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >. When you provide Caradil a payment method, you authorize Caradil, or
  third-party service providers acting on behalf of Caradil, to store your
  payment credential for future use in the event you owe Caradil any money. You
  authorize Caradil to use stored payment credentials for balances, including
  for&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/en-us/articles/203991170-Trip-costs"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >Trip costs</a
  >,&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/en-us/articles/203990780-Fees-fines"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >host fees</a
  >, and&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060440134-Guest-fees"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >guest fees&nbsp;</a
  >(e.g., late fees, security deposits, processing fees and claims costs, and
  related administrative fees). In some cases, our payment processors have
  arrangements with card networks to automatically update stored payment
  credentials whenever you receive a new card (e.g., replacing an expired card
  or one that was reported lost or stolen) and we will rely on such updates to
  stored payment credentials for balances. Any use of referral travel credit is
  governed by the terms and conditions outlined in&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/en-us/articles/204008484-Promotions-and-discounts"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<h4>Collection of fees</h4>
<p>
  Caradil and its service providers will employ all legal methods available to
  collect amounts due, including the engagement of collection agencies or legal
  counsel. Caradil, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report
  information about your Caradil Account to credit bureaus. As a result, late
  payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Caradil Account may be
  reflected in your credit report. In addition to the amount due, delinquent
  accounts or chargebacks will be charged with fees and/or charges that are
  incidental to the collection of delinquent accounts or chargebacks including,
  but not limited to, collection fees, convenience fees, and/or other third
  party charges. If you wish to dispute the information Caradil reported to a
  credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion), please contact&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >support.Caradil.com</a
  >. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a
  credit bureau regarding your Caradil Account, you must contact the collection
  agency directly.
</p>
<h4>Taxes</h4>
<p>
  In certain jurisdictions, Caradil may enable the collection and remittance of
  certain taxes from or on behalf of guests or hosts, based on existing and
  future tax regulations, including marketplace facilitator or car sharing
  regulations. The amount of taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Caradil
  will be visible to, and separately stated, to both guests and hosts on their
  respective trip related documents and invoices. Where Caradil is facilitating
  the collection and remittance of taxes, hosts are not permitted to collect the
  same taxes on the Services in relation to their vehicle sharing in that
  jurisdiction.
</p>

  worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual (or for the term of the protection),
  non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to

  only in the United States (excluding New York), the United Kingdom, and the
  Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and
  Quebec. Protection plan details and other specifics can be found&nbsp;<a

    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >specific terms for hosts</a
  >&nbsp;sections below for additional information based on the nature of your
  use of the Services.
</p>
<h3><strong>Specific terms for guests</strong></h3>
<p>
  The following sections also apply if you book a vehicle using the Services:
</p>
<h4>Guest commitments</h4>
<p>
  As a guest, you commit that you will be a legally licensed driver and provide
  proof to the host or via the Services of a current, valid driver’s license.
  You will treat the vehicle and any applicable Extras well and will take all
  reasonable measures to return the vehicle and any applicable Extras on time
  and in essentially the same condition as received. You will not allow anyone
  other than a person listed in the trip details as an Approved Driver to drive
  the vehicle you booked.
</p>
<h4>Guest financial responsibility for physical damage to the vehicle</h4>
<p>
  The guest that booked the trip (“primary guest”) is financially responsible
  for all physical damage to or theft of a booked vehicle that occurs during a
  trip, plus any additional costs and fees resulting from damage of any kind to
  the vehicle, regardless of who is found to be at fault. This responsibility
  applies whether the primary guest has their own auto insurance or not.
</p>
<p>
  Primary guests may be insured against damage to the booked vehicle under their
  own automobile policies. When you book a vehicle on Caradil, you agree that if
  any damage occurs to the booked vehicle during the booked trip, you will work
  with Caradil to make a claim for coverage under any policy of insurance that
  applies to the loss.
</p>
<p>
  The primary guest can limit the amount they are obligated to pay out of their
  own pocket in the event there is damage to the booked vehicle during the
  booked trip by choosing a protection plan on the Services. The limitation on
  the amount a primary guest may have to pay out of pocket included in any
  protection plan only applies (1) if the primary guest and any Approved Driver
  abide by these Terms and (2) to physical damage that is not mechanical or
  interior damage.

<h4>Auto liability insurance</h4>
<p>
  Most hosts offering a vehicle for sharing on the Services cannot offer
  liability insurance to you. All protection plans offered on the Services
  include coverage under an automobile liability insurance policy. In the US,
  the policy is issued to Caradil by Travelers Excess and Surplus Lines Company
  and does not provide a defense or indemnification for any claim asserted by
  Caradil. In the UK, this policy is arranged by Aon UK Ltd. and purchased from
  Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance UK Ltd. In the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Nova
  Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec this policy is purchased from Economical Insurance
  and in British Columbia, Insurance Corporation of British Columbia.
</p>
<p>
  If the guest has their own personal auto policy, it will be primary over the
  Caradil protection depending on various factors such as applicable laws, where
  the guest books the vehicle, and/or where the accident or damages occur. Terms
  and exclusions apply. Learn more about Guest protection plans including
  insurance in the&nbsp;<a

<h4>Booking with Commercial Hosts</h4>
<p>
  Where a host can offer guests at least legally required minimum insurance
  through their own commercial or rental policy, the host may choose to decline
  insurance on the Services and provide its own policy directly to you as the
  guest. We refer to these hosts as “Commercial Hosts.” You can determine
  directly in the vehicle listing whether the vehicle is offered by a Commercial
  Host.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >If you book with a Commercial Host, no third-party automobile liability
    insurance, financial responsibility limitations for physical damage, or
    roadside assistance is made available via the Services by Caradil or any
    third-party insurance partners, brokers, or producers. The Commercial Host
    will bill you directly for any applicable protection plan after booking, not
    through the Services. In these circumstances, a Commercial Host may require
    you to sign additional paperwork, provide a deposit, or pay additional fees,
    costs, or taxes after booking, for instance when picking up the vehicle. A
    Commercial Host may also have additional requirements that differ from
    Caradil requirements (like requiring a credit card deposit).</strong
  >&nbsp;By booking a vehicle where a Commercial Host is providing protection,
  you agree that the Commercial Host may impose additional terms and fees after
  booking.
</p>
<h4>Use of the vehicle</h4>
<p>
  When you book a vehicle on the Services, you must use the vehicle only for
  your personal use and not for any commercial purposes (e.g. driving other
  passengers for a fee such as through Uber or Lyft or delivering food or other
  packages) unless you have express written permission from the Caradil Legal
  Department in advance or as otherwise described&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/articles/360046509914"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >. You may not access a vehicle until the trip start time and you must return
  the vehicle on time and to the correct location. You must present the host
  with a current, valid driver’s license. You must exercise reasonable care in
  your use of the vehicle. You are required at all times to operate the vehicle
  safely, and in compliance with all applicable laws, including without
  limitation, speed limits and prohibitions on impaired or distracted driving.
  In the event Caradil has any concern about your use of a vehicle, Caradil may
  terminate your trip in its discretion at any time and require the return of
  the vehicle, including recovering the vehicle on behalf of the host. You are
  required to wear seat belts during the operation of the vehicle and to require
  that all of your passengers wear seat belts. You are also required to meet any
  laws or regulations concerning child safety seats and other protections for
  children. You must not leave the car unlocked or with the keys unsecure (such
  as in the ignition). You must not engage in any&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/articles/203990570"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >prohibited uses</a
  >&nbsp;with any vehicle you book through the Services. The prohibited uses
  list is not meant to be exhaustive. If you have any concerns about your
  planned use, please contact&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >support.Caradil.com</a
  >. If you misuse a vehicle, you will be fully financially responsible for any
  related claims, loss, or damage, and your protection plan may be
  voided.&nbsp;<strong
    >Guests also acknowledge that using a vehicle in a prohibited manner or
    otherwise breaching the Agreement may lower available liability coverage to
    legal minimum limits, or nullify coverage, and may furthermore nullify any
    comprehensive or collision protection and/or protection plan where allowed
    by applicable law</strong
  >.
</p>
<h4>Condition of the vehicle and optional Extras</h4>
<p>
  You understand that third parties own the vehicles and Extras offered through
  the Services. Each host is responsible for complying with all legal
  requirements (including ensuring the vehicle is registered and insured) and
  maintaining their vehicle(s) in safe and roadworthy condition. Please complete
  a visual inspection before you begin your use of the vehicle. If you find
  damage in your initial inspection, you should upload photos of such
  pre-existing damage at the start of your reservation as described&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/en-us/articles/207964907-Trip-photos-guide-Guests"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >&nbsp;to ensure you are not held responsible for pre-existing damage. If you
  find damage on your initial inspection and fail to report it, Caradil,
  third-party administrators, or insurance partners, may assume that the damage
  occurred during your reservation period. If, after your initial inspection,
  you believe that the vehicle is not safe to drive, please do not use the
  vehicle; instead, please contact the Caradil team immediately at
  1-415-965-4525 in the US, +44-8081894113 in the United Kingdom, or
  888-391-0460 in Canada.
</p>
<h4>No responsibility for shared vehicles</h4>
<p>
  You acknowledge that Caradil is not responsible and shall not be liable for
  the safety, roadworthiness, or legal status (e.g., whether the vehicle is
  legally registered or the subject of a stolen vehicle report) of any vehicles
  shared via the Services beyond our policies that require hosts to ensure their
  vehicles are in safe and operable condition, legally registered to be driven
  on public roads, not subject to a missing or stolen vehicle report, have a
  clean title (e.g., non-salvaged/non-branded/non-washed/non-written off), not
  subject to any applicable safety recalls, and otherwise satisfy our&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/en-us/articles/203991940"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >eligibility requirements</a
  >.
</p>
<h4>Incident reporting</h4>
<p>
  Where you elected for a protection plan when booking your trip via the
  Services, you must immediately report any damage to the vehicle you are using
  to Caradil at&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >support.Caradil.com</a
  >, or 1-415-965-4525 in the US, +44-8081894113 in the United Kingdom, or
  888-391-0460 in Canada. If there has been a collision, you must also make a
  report to the police. You will need to use all reasonable efforts to secure
  evidence from any available witnesses and to provide Caradil or third-party
  claims administrators with a written description of the incident and any other
  information requested, including identity and insurance information of any
  parties involved in the incident. You are also required to cooperate in any
  loss investigation conducted by Caradil, third party claims administrators, or
  insurers. After an incident, you may not continue to use the vehicle unless
  you have the explicit permission of Caradil staff. Failure to timely report an
  incident or cooperate in an investigation may reduce or invalidate any
  protection plan received via the Services.
</p>
<h4>Vehicle theft</h4>
<p>
  The following conduct may result in the reporting of the vehicle you have
  booked as stolen to law enforcement, possibly subjecting you and any other
  driver to arrest, and civil and/or criminal penalties, and the voiding of your
  protection plan:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you fail to return the vehicle you booked at the time and place agreed
    upon with the host and/or designated in your reservation
  </li>
  <li>
    If you do not return the vehicle by the end of the reservation period and
    you have not properly obtained an extension of the reservation through the
    Services as set forth&nbsp;<a
      href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/articles/360043107954"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      target="_blank"
      >here</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    If the vehicle is returned to any place other than the return location on
    the reservation or agreed upon with the host. Any damage to, or loss or
    theft of, a vehicle occurring prior to the host inspecting the vehicle upon
    return at the end of the reservation is the guest’s responsibility
  </li>
  <li>
    If you misrepresent facts to the host pertaining to booking, use, or
    operation of vehicle
  </li>
  <li>
    If the vehicle’s interior components are stolen or damaged or the vehicle
    itself is stolen or damaged when the vehicle is left unlocked or running or
    unattended with the keys not secured during reservation period
  </li>
  <li>
    If you fail or refuse to communicate in good faith with the host, police,
    Caradil, or other authorities with a full report of any accident or
    vandalism involving the vehicle or otherwise fail to cooperate in the
    investigation of any accident or vandalism
  </li>
  <li>
    If the vehicle is operated by anyone who has given a fictitious name, false
    address, or a false or invalid driver’s license, whose driver’s license
    becomes invalid during the reservation period, who has obtained the keys
    without permission of the host, or who misrepresents or withholds facts
    to/from the host or Caradil material to the booking, use, or operation of
    vehicle
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The primary guest who books the reservation is responsible for any private
  investigation costs Caradil deems necessary to recover a vehicle that is not
  returned. In addition, a $500 case administration fee will be imposed on the
  primary guest if Caradil and/or the host has to report a vehicle as stolen to
  law enforcement due to it not being returned.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Repossession.</strong>&nbsp;Caradil, a hired agent of Caradil, or the
  host may repossess any vehicle booked through the Services without demand, at
  the guest’s expense, if the vehicle is not returned by the end of the
  reservation, is found illegally parked, apparently abandoned, or used in
  violation of applicable law or these Terms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Missing Vehicles.</strong>&nbsp;If a vehicle you have booked through
  the Services goes missing and/or is stolen during the reservation period (or
  extension period), you must immediately return the original ignition key to
  the host, file a police report immediately after discovering the vehicle is
  missing or stolen, but in no event more than 24 hours after discovering it has
  gone missing, and cooperate fully with the host, law enforcement, Caradil, and
  other authorities in all matters related to the investigation.
</p>
<h3><strong>Specific terms for hosts</strong></h3>
<p>
  The following sections also apply if you share your vehicle through the
  Services:
</p>
<h4>Host commitments</h4>
<p>
  As a host, you commit that you will provide a safe and legally registered and
  insured vehicle, with current license plates, with a clean
  (non-salvage/branded/written off) title, and in good mechanical condition. You
  will provide such vehicle on time but only to a guest who is listed on the
  Services as an Approved Driver for the trip. You commit that your listings
  will be complete and accurate and you will honor all representations made in
  your listings, including honoring the price quoted to a guest. You will not
  cancel a booking for the purpose of seeking a higher price from a guest. You
  will not offer any vehicle or optional Extra that you do not yourself own or
  have authority to share or that may not be shared for compensation pursuant to
  the terms and conditions of any agreement with a third party, including, but
  not limited to, a lease or financing agreement. You will not offer any Extra
  that is not safe, clean, and acceptable for the use it is intended. You will
  not offer any vehicle that is the subject of a missing or stolen vehicle
  report. You will not offer any vehicle that is the subject of a safety recall
  without first properly addressing the matter subject to the recall. You will
  not offer a vehicle that is not roadworthy (i.e., not “street legal”) in the
  location where it is shared and it will not have any illegal modifications to
  any part of the vehicle. You will remove any firearms or other weapons from
  your vehicle prior to providing it to a guest. You will repay loans related to
  your Caradil business on time and in full.
</p>
<h4>Information given at registration</h4>
<p>
  When you sign up for Caradil, you will identify passenger vehicle(s) that you
  want to list for sharing through the Services. Each vehicle must meet the
  requirements found&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/articles/203991940"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >. You may only use the Services in connection with vehicles that you own or
  otherwise have all the necessary rights and permissions to share for
  compensation.
</p>
<h4>Listing only on the Services</h4>
<p>
  Except for vehicles listed in Canada, any vehicle you list on the Services
  must be exclusively listed on the Services. You cannot list any vehicles you
  intend to share on the Services on any other car sharing marketplace. Failure
  to abide by this condition may result in fines, penalties, denial of physical
  damage claims, removal of the vehicle from the Services, account closure, or
  other action, in Caradil’s sole discretion. Learn more about this
  policy&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024861273-Exclusivity-policy"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >. This does not limit Commercial Hosts’ (as defined below) ability to
  maintain their own rental car business or prohibit a vehicle from being listed
  on ride sharing or other delivery services when not on a Caradil reservation.
</p>
<h4>Caradil photography</h4>
<p>
  Caradil may offer hosts the option of having photographers take photographs of
  their vehicles and/or hosts with their vehicles (“Images”). You alone are
  responsible for using the Images in connection with your Caradil listing and
  you agree that you will cease using the Images if they no longer accurately
  represent your vehicle. You agree that Caradil is the sole and exclusive owner
  - or exclusive licensee, as allowed by applicable law - of all right, title,
  and interest in all copyrights, trademark rights, and any and all other
  intellectual property rights, including right of publicity, worldwide, in the
  Images regardless of whether you include them in your listing, and you shall
  take no action to challenge or object to the validity of such rights or
  Caradil’s ownership or registration thereof. You acknowledge that Caradil may
  use the Images for advertising, marketing, commercial, and other business
  purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your listing or
  otherwise, without further notice or compensation. Further, you waive any and
  all rights to royalties or moral rights you may have in the Images. If you use
  the Caradil photography program, you agree that you will not use the Images in
  connection with sharing your vehicle on any platform, website, or application
  other than Caradil. At Caradil’s request, you will execute documents and take
  such further acts as Caradil may reasonably request to assist Caradil to
  acquire, perfect, and maintain its intellectual property rights and other
  legal protection in the Images.
</p>
<h4>Vehicle availability</h4>
<p>
  Once a trip is booked, you must make the vehicle available or deliver the
  vehicle as expected by the guest. If you offer the guest the option to pick up
  your vehicle at a persistent specified location, you must supply the location
  of the vehicle accurately to Caradil and ensure that the vehicle is available
  at that location at the beginning of the reservation period. In order to
  qualify for available protection plans,&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/articles/203991680"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >you must verify that a prospective guest has a current, valid driver’s
    license</a
  >&nbsp;before you provide the guest your vehicle, and ensure the driver’s
  license matches the name on the reservation and that the person picking up the
  vehicle appears to match the photograph on a facially valid driver’s license.
</p>
<h4>Pricing, earnings, and payments</h4>
<p>
  You will have the ability to set and revise the vehicle’s pricing as you
  choose. Caradil will pay you the amount collected from guests that book your
  vehicle, less the applicable fees payable to Caradil. A description of fees
  can be found&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/articles/203992000"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >. To the extent you owe Caradil or any third party lender (including via Kiva
  Microfunds) money for any reason, Caradil also reserves the right to deduct
  those amounts from your earnings payment, debit your bank account, charge any
  of your payment methods on file, and/or send you an invoice.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Payment Processing.</strong>&nbsp;In some countries, payment
  processing services are provided by Stripe and subject to the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a
  >, which includes the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://stripe.com/us/legal"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >Stripe Services Agreement</a
  >&nbsp;(collectively, the "Stripe Terms"). In countries where you receive
  payment proceeds via Stripe, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Terms, which
  may be modified from time to time. As a condition of Caradil enabling payment
  processing services through Stripe, you authorize Caradil to obtain all
  necessary access and perform all necessary activity on your Stripe Connected
  Account to facilitate sharing of your vehicle. You further agree to provide
  accurate and complete information about you, and authorize Caradil to share it
  and transaction information with Stripe for the purposes of facilitating the
  payment processing services provided by Stripe. Caradil reserves the right to
  switch payment processing vendors at its discretion.
</p>
<h4>Airport delivery; personal vehicle sharing regulations</h4>
<p>
  Some airports where you offer delivery may take the position that you must
  have a permit to use airport premises and remit fees. While Caradil does not
  believe that rental car permits should apply to peer-to-peer car sharing, not
  all airport authorities agree with this position. Learn more about airport
  delivery&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042265173-Airport-delivery-information"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  There is personal vehicle sharing legislation that may apply to you. More
  information is available&nbsp;<a

    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<h4>Maintenance</h4>
<p>
  You are required to regularly check your vehicle for any defects in its
  operations or safety. You promise that, at all times, your vehicle will be in
  safe and roadworthy condition, in good mechanical condition, and in full
  compliance with all applicable inspection and registration requirements. You
  will only list vehicles with a clean, non-salvaged, non-written off,
  non-washed, and non-branded title. You agree to respond to any applicable
  recall or similar safety notices and to complete any recommended action before
  allowing your vehicle to be booked. In addition, if Caradil believes that your
  vehicle does not conform to reasonable standards, Caradil may notify you and
  reserves the right to remove or decline listing your vehicle until its
  concerns have been resolved. Caradil may, but does not commit to, undertake
  efforts to ensure the safety of vehicles booked through the Services. Learn
  more about our vehicle eligibility requirements&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/hc/articles/203991940"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<h4>Reporting vehicle damage</h4>
<p>
  If you did not decline a protection plan made available via the Services, and
  you believe that a guest has caused any damage to your vehicle, you are
  required to report that damage as soon as you become aware of it (and in any
  event, no more than 24 hours after the scheduled end of the trip) and to
  provide reasonable cooperation in the investigation of the damage so that it
  can be eligible for coverage. Based on the investigation, Caradil or
  third-party claims administrators will reasonably determine whether the damage
  occurred during the reservation period and is eligible for coverage. If it
  was, and you did not decline a protection plan made available via the
  Services, you will be reimbursed for the loss as described in the sections
  below. If Caradil is not given prompt notice as described in this paragraph,
  or if you do not provide reasonable cooperation in the investigation by
  Caradil or third-party claims administrators, we may not be able to determine
  the cause. In that case, you agree that we may decline any reimbursement or
  coverage for such damage.
</p>
<h4>Liability insurance</h4>
<p>
  All host protection plans offered on the Services include coverage under a
  third-party automobile liability insurance policy. In the US, the policy is
  issued to Caradil by Travelers Excess and Surplus Lines Company and does not
  provide a defense or indemnification for any claim asserted by Caradil. In the
  UK, the policy is from Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance UK Ltd., arranged by Aon UK
  Ltd. In the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec,
  the policy is from Economical Insurance and in British Columbia the policy is
  from Insurance Corporation of British Columbia.
</p>
<h4>Physical damage to your vehicle</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Physical damage reimbursement (US).</strong>&nbsp;The protection plans
  available to hosts in the US also address the allocation of financial
  consequences of physical damage to the vehicle offered by a host during a
  trip. Physical damage contractual reimbursement from Caradil applies to your
  vehicle in the event of a collision and to most comprehensive events during
  the trip, and is subject to terms and exclusions. Learn more about US host

  <strong>Physical damage reimbursement and coverage (UK).</strong>&nbsp;The
  protection plans available to hosts in the UK also address the allocation of
  financial consequences of physical damage to the vehicle offered by a host
  during a trip. Up to £10,000, contractual reimbursement from Caradil applies
  to your vehicle in the event of a collision and to most comprehensive events
  during the trip and is subject to terms and exclusives. Coverage for physical
  damage to your vehicle beyond £10,000 is addressed in the policy from Aioi
  Nissay Dowa Insurance UK Ltd., subject to terms and exclusions. Learn more

<p>
  <strong>Actual cash value.</strong>&nbsp;If Caradil, or third-party claims
  administrators, choose to pay you the actual cash value for your vehicle, you
  will be required to transfer title to the vehicle to Caradil or a third party
  appointed by Caradil to accept title. The standard for determining the actual
  cash value will be as determined by Caradil or its third-party claims
  administrators and in compliance with applicable law.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Exclusions to physical damage reimbursement and coverage.</strong
  >&nbsp;Protection plans selected by hosts on the Services do not apply to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Optional extras or personal property, including aftermarket installations
    (e.g., equipment racks), that are taken from your vehicle or damaged during
    a trip. Remove all personal property before making your vehicle available
    for a reservation

  it on the Services (for example, falsely represent the make, model, or year of
  the vehicle),&nbsp;<strong
    >any protection plan you selected will be voided</strong
  >. A protection will be voided under this provision even if the underlying
  circumstances are not directly related to the damage or harm at issue. You
  acknowledge that these provisions are material and that they serve to ensure
  your compliance. In the event your protection plan is voided, the remainder of
  the Agreement, these Terms, and our&nbsp;<a

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Other host-specific insurance matters.</strong>&nbsp;You will maintain
  valid and up to date registration information and proof of insurance in any
  vehicle you share on the Services. You must maintain your own auto insurance
  policy for any vehicle you list on the Services and such policy must meet any
  minimum insurance levels required by law. You agree to provide Caradil with
  information regarding your auto insurance policy as may be requested and to
  keep such information up to date. Where not prohibited by law, you hereby
  appoint Caradil or a wholly owned subsidiary of Caradil as your
  attorney-in-fact for the purpose of filing insurance claims, receiving
  insurance payment, otherwise administering an applicable insurance policy,
  and/or working with law enforcement, guests, or private entities to recover
  your vehicle, as necessary.
</p>
<h4>Missing vehicles</h4>
<p>
  If you selected a protection plan via the Services and your vehicle goes
  missing, is not returned, and/or is stolen during the reservation period (or
  extension period), you, as the host, must immediately contact a Caradil
  representative and follow his or her instructions, including cooperating with
  Caradil, the police, and any other authorities in all related to the
  investigation of the theft. If you are instructed by Caradil to file a police
  report, you must do so within 24 hours of receiving those instructions.
</p>
<h4>Additional provisions applicable in Quebec</h4>
<p>
  Each host in Quebec grants Caradil the right to use and enjoy the vehicle,
  solely during the sharing period, subject to Caradil’s obligations to the host
  to preserve the substance of the vehicle pursuant to this Agreement. Each host
  in Quebec agrees that Caradil’s obligation to preserve the substance of his or
  her vehicle is fulfilled by Caradil obtaining commercial automobile insurance
  coverage, the terms, limitations, and exclusions of which are set out in the
  standard form automobile policy applicable in the province of Quebec (Q.P.F.
  no. 1).
</p>
<h4>Indemnification of host</h4>
<p>
  If you selected a protection plan via the Services, in the event of any claim
  for a loss or injury that occurs during the use of your vehicle by a guest (or
  by Caradil itself), subject to your compliance with these Terms and the
  Policies, Caradil or its insurers will defend and indemnify you, subject to
  any exclusions or limitations in the policy or policies of insurance contained
  with the protection plan, against such claims as required by applicable law.
  In connection with any indemnified claim, you are required to give Caradil or
  its insurers prompt written notice of the claim, allow Caradil sole control
  over the defense of the claim, and provide Caradil reasonable cooperation in
  its defense of the claim, at Caradil’s expense. If Caradil or its insurers
  reimburses you for a lost or damaged vehicle and you later receive payment for
  some or all of your vehicle from a third party (e.g. a third party insurance
  company or restitution), you must reimburse Caradil any monies received from
  that third party in an amount equivalent to, but not to exceed, the funds
  provided to you by Caradil.
</p>
<h4>Additional terms for Commercial Hosts</h4>
<p>
  If you decline a protection plan made available via the Services (such as if
  you choose to offer your own commercial/rental policy to guests) or where no
  protection plan is offered via the Services you are a "Commercial Host."
</p>
<p>
  In exchange for keeping more of the trip price for yourself, when you decline
  a Caradil protection package or where no protection package is offered, you
  waive, on behalf of yourself and any affiliated individuals (including, but
  not limited to, employees, employers, associates, contractors, or any other
  related personnel) or entities (whether they be corporations, partnerships,
  sole proprietorships, limited liability companies, or otherwise)
  (collectively, “Affiliates”) any protection plan normally offered via the
  Services, to you or any Affiliates, your vehicles, and any guests or approved
  drivers of all of the vehicles you list on Caradil.
</p>
<p>
  When you choose to provide your own commercial rental insurance in the United
  States, the United Kingdom, or Canada, or where no protection or insurance is
  offered via the Services in your region, you, as the host, or an authorized
  representative acting on behalf of the host, shall be exclusively responsible
  for providing commercial rental insurance coverage for any reservation of your
  vehicles through Caradil. You shall carry no less than the minimum applicable
  liability and/or physical damage automobile insurance for your vehicle, your
  guest, and his/her authorized drivers. When you select to decline a protection
  plan or where none is offered in your region, you represent and warrant that
  (1) you are a licensed commercial rental car company or are authorized to act
  on behalf of and bind a commercial rental car company in connection with
  listing vehicles on Caradil, or (2) you are an individual or company, or are
  authorized to act on behalf of, and bind a company, that can offer commercial
  rental car insurance to guests.
</p>
<p>
  You further acknowledge and agree that you shall receive no protection or
  coverage from Caradil or any affiliates, whether that be financial
  responsibility for physical damage, third-party liability protection,
  uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, PIP or any similar coverage or
  indemnification, roadside assistance, or trust and safety support as part of a
  booking of your vehicle when you have chosen to provide your own commercial
  rental insurance.&nbsp;<strong
    >You shall add Caradil as an additional insured on all applicable automobile
    and excess liability policies.</strong
  >&nbsp;These provisions replace and supersede any representation made by
  Caradil, or those acting on behalf of Caradil, including but not limited to
  statements made on the Services, these Terms, Help Center, Policies, emails,
  and/or marketing materials, concerning protection plans, insurance, and
  roadside assistance otherwise offered to host and guests when the hosts do not
  decline protection via the Services.
</p>
<p>
  Caradil reserves the right to, but does not commit to, satisfy itself that you
  are, or are acting on behalf of, a licensed commercial rental car company and
  have the ability to offer commercial auto rental insurance to renters/drivers
  of your vehicles when you choose to decline protection. If Caradil has any
  concerns in this regard, you agree that Caradil can automatically, and in its
  sole discretion, default all of your vehicles to a protection plan of our
  choice, along with its associated fees (if offered in your region), remove
  your listings, or suspend your Caradil Account.
</p>
<p>
  If you lose the ability to offer commercial rental insurance to your guests
  (for example, your policy has been canceled or nonrenewed), you must
  immediately change the status of your vehicle. If the change is temporary, you
  can snooze your vehicle(s). If you need to permanently change the protection
  plan for your vehicle(s) back to a protection plan made available via the
  Services, contact us at&nbsp;<a
    href="https://support.Caradil.com/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >support.Caradil.com</a
  >. Never let a guest pick up a vehicle or continue to use a vehicle without
  providing them insurance coverage.
</p>
<p>
  You must disclose on your listing page any applicable additional fees, costs,
  and/or taxes you assess in addition to other requirements you may impose (such
  as a security deposit or if you do not accept debit cards, for example). You
  must never surprise guests with hidden costs or requirements at pick-up.
  Caradil reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to default your vehicles
  to a protection plan of our choice, remove your listings, or suspend your
  Caradil Account for failure to be transparent with guests about fees, costs,
  and requirements in your vehicle listing page.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >You acknowledge that the actual damages likely to result from your breach
    of this section are difficult to estimate accurately and would be difficult
    for Caradil to prove with certainty. You will pay Caradil USD$5,500 per
    breach in liquidated damages to compensate Caradil for any such conduct.
    This amount is not intended as a punishment for any such breach, but rather
    as a reasonable estimate where actual damages are difficult to estimate
    accurately and/or prove with certainty.</strong

</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >You shall defend, indemnify, and hold Caradil, its subsidiaries,
    affiliates, employees, officers, directors, and agents, and any of your
    guests or their authorized drivers, harmless from and against any and all
    claims, demands, suits, judgments, costs, expenses, liabilities, attorneys
    fees, damages, consequential damages, punitive damages, property damage,
    personal injury, theft or otherwise, without limitation, related to or
    arising out of any reservation or use of any vehicles, including without
    limitation, any vehicle damage, personal injury or property damage where you
    have declined a protection plan made available via the Services or one is
    not available in your region.</strong

<p>
  <strong>Pre-arbitration dispute resolution.&nbsp;</strong>Should a dispute or
  claim arise between us, you and Caradil agree to notify the other Party of the
  nature of the dispute or claim prior to initiating arbitration, and the
  Parties will attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will
  contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact us
  by email at&nbsp;<a
    href="mailto:noticeofdispute@Caradil.com"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >noticeofdispute@Caradil.com</a
  >&nbsp;. Please provide your name, phone number, email, mailing address, and
  briefly describe both the nature of your dispute and the relief you would like
  from Caradil. If the Parties are unable to resolve the claims described in the
  notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, then the Party intending to
  pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other Party via email prior to
  initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be
  filed with either FairClaims or the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
  as set forth below, pursuant to the FairClaims Rules or AAA’s Consumer
  Arbitration Rules, as appropriate. A form for initiating arbitration
  proceedings is available on the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.fairclaims.com/"

    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >Demand for Arbitration form</a
  >.) Any settlement offer made by you or Caradil shall not be disclosed to the
  arbitrator.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Applicable law.</strong>&nbsp;The below Agreement to Arbitrate
  evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and is therefore
  governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the applicable procedural rules of
  FairClaims or AAA, as applicable (see "Arbitration procedures" below). To the
  extent state law is applicable to the Agreement to Arbitrate, the Parties
  agree that the substantive law of the state of Arizona will apply, without
  regard to its conflict of law provisions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong>&nbsp;The Parties each agree that any
  and all disputes, claims, or controversies that have arisen or may arise at
  any time between you and Caradil (including its respective subsidiaries,
  employees, officers, directors, agents, third-party insurance brokers or
  products, and third-party claims administrators) will be resolved by binding
  arbitration according to the procedure set forth below. For the purpose of
  this Agreement to Arbitrate, “disputes," "claims,” and "controversies" shall
  have the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and includes, any and
  all disputes and/or claims that arise out of or in any way relate to your
  relationship with Caradil, including but not limited to: (1) your use of the
  Services, (2) the Agreement, these Terms and/or this Agreement to Arbitrate,
  including the interpretation, validity, enforceability, or scope of this
  Agreement to Arbitrate, or (3) your use of, or access to the Services, and
  anything sold, offered, or purchased through the Services (such as booking,
  listing, or sharing a vehicle). Through this Agreement to Arbitrate, and
  subject to the below exceptions, the Parties intend to arbitrate all disputes
  or claims regardless of whether they are based in contract, statute,
  regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud,
  misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal
  or equitable theory and regardless of whether they arose or accrued before the
  Parties entered into this Agreement to Arbitrate.&nbsp;For avoidance of doubt,
  the Parties expressly agree that this Agreement to Arbitrate encompasses all
  disputes or claims pertaining to the validity, enforceability, or scope of
  this Agreement to Arbitrate and any such disputes or claims will be referred
  to binding arbitration and will be resolved by the arbitrator and not a court.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>&nbsp;The only exceptions
  to this Agreement to Arbitrate are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disputes or claims that can be brought in small claims court</li>
  <li>
    Injunctive or equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened
    infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a Party’s copyrights,
    trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
    However, the Parties agree that any court proceedings shall be stayed
    pending the final resolution in arbitration of any arbitrable claims or
    issues
  </li>
  <li>
    Any cause of action or claim for relief which cannot be arbitrated as a
    matter of applicable statute or public policy. However, the Parties agree
    that any such court proceedings shall be stayed pending the final resolution
    in arbitration of any arbitrable claims or issues
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event California law is found to apply to this Agreement to
    Arbitrate, any remedy of public injunctive relief (i.e., injunctive relief
    that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that
    threaten future injury to the general public). However, the Parties agree
    that any such court proceedings shall be stayed pending the final resolution
    in arbitration of arbitrable claims, causes of action, or issues
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Arbitration procedures.</strong>&nbsp;Arbitration is more informal
  than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a
  judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. An
  arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a
  court can award to an individual.
</p>
<p>
  The arbitration will be conducted by&nbsp;<a
    href="http://www.fairclaims.com/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >FairClaims</a
  >&nbsp;in accordance with its Arbitration Rules and Procedures effective at
  the time a claim is made. Where the relief sought is $25,000 or less (not
  including attorneys' fees and expenses), those Arbitration Rules and
  Procedures may limit the proceeding to a written submission and, if requested
  or at the arbitrator’s discretion, there may be a live hearing by
  teleconference or videoconference. Where the relief sought is $25,001 or more
  (not including attorneys’ fees and expenses), those Arbitration Rules and
  Procedures may provide for limited discovery and streamlined proceedings. In
  the event FairClaims declines to or is unable to adjudicate the claim, the
  arbitration will be conducted by the&nbsp;<a
    href="http://www.adr.org/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >AAA</a
  >&nbsp;under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement
  to Arbitrate.
</p>
<p>
  In all cases in which a live hearing is requested or required, you and/or
  Caradil may attend by video or phone. To the extent a location must be
  established for the arbitration, it shall be held in the county in which you
  reside or at another mutually agreed location.
</p>
<p>
  The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
  applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all
  claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by
  rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but is bound by
  rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Caradil user to the extent
  required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding
  and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
  court having jurisdiction thereof.
</p>
<p>
  Where permitted, the Parties agree that all communications, evidence, and
  rulings in the arbitration will remain confidential, except as reasonably
  necessary to enforce or implement such rulings or this Agreement to Arbitrate.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Costs of arbitration.</strong>&nbsp;If you initiate arbitration
  proceedings, you will be responsible for certain costs. Where the relief
  sought is $25,000 or less (not including attorneys’ fees and expenses), you
  will be responsible for the initial filing fee, capped at $375, and Caradil
  will cover any additional fees or costs. Where the relief sought is $25,001 or
  more (not including attorneys’ fees and expenses), you and Caradil will each
  pay your own arbitration fees consistent with the rules set by FairClaims (or
  AAA, as applicable) at the time the claim was made, unless otherwise stated in
  these Terms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Severability.</strong>&nbsp;With the exception of the provisions in
  the below section “Prohibition of class and representative actions and
  non-individualized relief,” if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of
  the Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of the
  Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If an arbitrator or court decides
  that any of the provisions in the section “Prohibition of class and
  representative actions and non-individualized relief” is invalid or
  unenforceable, then the entirety of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null
  and void. The remainder of the Agreement, these Terms, and&nbsp;<a

  Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other provisions
  of the Agreement will continue to apply to you, including the below forum
  selection clause specifying Phoenix, Arizona.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Future amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong
  >&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, the
  Parties agree that if Caradil makes any amendment to the Agreement to
  Arbitrate in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that you
  filed against Caradil prior to the effective date of the amendment. The
  amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the
  Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between the Parties. If
  you do not agree to the amended terms, you may close your account within 30
  days of our posting or notification and you will not be bound by the amended
  terms; provided that the Parties will arbitrate any dispute in accordance with
  the provisions of the Agreement to Arbitrate as of the date you last accepted
  these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms). Once you have
  submitted a valid Opt-Out Notice to Caradil, you do NOT need to submit another
  one when these Terms are subsequently updated. Your first Opt-Out Notice will
  serve as a valid as to future versions of these Terms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Judicial forum for legal disputes not subject to arbitration.</strong
  >&nbsp;Unless the Parties agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to
  Arbitrate is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute,
  whether (1) as a result of your decision to opt out of the Agreement to
  Arbitrate, (2) as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order,
  or (3) if one of the above exceptions to the Agreement to Arbitrate applies,
  you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between the
  Parties will be resolved exclusively by a state, federal, or small claims
  court located in Phoenix, Arizona. The Parties agree to submit to the personal
  jurisdiction of a state court located in Maricopa County, Phoenix, Arizona or
  a United States District Court for the District of Arizona located in Phoenix,
  Arizona. The Parties agree that the substantive law of the state of Arizona
  will apply to any such claim or dispute without regard to conflict of law
  provisions.

<p>
  <strong

  >&nbsp;THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
  ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
  PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN COURT OR
  ARBITRATION. UNLESS THE PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE COURT OR ARBITRATOR MAY
  NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT
  OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS
  PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE COURT OR ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING
  MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL
  PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF
  NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT

<p>
  <strong>Resolution of disputes.</strong>&nbsp;If a dispute arises between the
  Parties and you are a resident of Canada, our goal is to provide you with a
  neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. We strongly
  encourage you to first contact us. We will consider reasonable requests to
  resolve the dispute through more informal means. If we are unable to resolve
  the dispute in such manner, the Parties agree that we will resolve any claim
  or controversy at law or equity that arises out of the Agreement or the
  Services in accordance with the "arbitration option" described below or as the
  Parties otherwise agree in writing.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Arbitration Option.</strong>&nbsp;For any claim (excluding claims for
  injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award
  sought is less than CAD$15,000, the Party requesting relief may seek to
  resolve the dispute in a cost-effective manner through binding
  non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event that a Party elects for
  arbitration and the other Party agrees to such arbitration, such arbitration
  shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution
  (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The ADR provider and the
  Parties must comply with the following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be
  conducted by phone, videoconference, and/or be solely based on written
  submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the Party initiating the
  arbitration, (2) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by
  the Parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties, and
  (3) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
  court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Law and forum for disputes.</strong>&nbsp;The laws of the Province of
  Ontario and the applicable federal laws of Canada shall govern the Agreement
  and any dispute or claim you have against Caradil in all respects unless you
  are a resident of Quebec. All residents of Canada, other than residents of
  Quebec, agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Caradil must be
  resolved by a court located in Toronto, Ontario, except as otherwise agreed by
  the Parties or as described in the "arbitration option" paragraph above. You
  agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the
  Province of Ontario for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes
  unless you are a resident of Quebec.

  jurisdiction of the English courts. If you are able to bring a claim arising

</p>
<p>
  THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND WAIVER PROVISIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL
  ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Caradil AND YOU. THEY SHALL APPLY

  DEEMED VOID OR UNENFORCEABLE SHALL BE SEVERED WHILE LEAVING THE REMAINDER IN
  EFFECT.
</p>
<h4>Indemnification</h4>
<p>
  You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Caradil and its
  subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, and agents, harmless from and
  against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including,
  without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in
  any way connected with: (1) your access to or use of the Services, (2) your
  violation of these Terms, (3) your user content, (4) your interaction with any
  other user of the Services, or (5) your booking of a vehicle or creation of a

  injuries, losses, or damages (compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential,
  or otherwise) arising in connection with or as a result of a booking, sharing,
  or use of a vehicle or optional Extra. This indemnification provision is a
  fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between Caradil and you. It
  shall apply to the extent permitted by applicable law, and any aspects of it
  that are deemed unenforceable shall be severed while leaving the remainder in
  effect.
</p>
<h4>Liquidated damages</h4>
<p>
  You acknowledge that the actual damages likely to result from your breaches of
  the Agreement by any of the following are difficult to estimate accurately and
  would be difficult for Caradil to prove with certainty: (1) engaging in gray
  market transactions, as defined in these Terms, (2) using the Caradil domains,
  trademarks, or taglines without Caradil's express consent, including without
  limitation registering website domains or social media handles, or bidding on
  online advertising key words, (3) suing or asserting legal claims against the
  Caradil Parties or a Caradil user in any manner prohibited or waived herein,
  (4) as a host, sharing your vehicle via the Services with expired registration
  stickers or without current registration paperwork in the vehicle, (5) as a
  host, offering any vehicle that is the subject of a missing or stolen vehicle
  report, (6) as a host, offering any vehicle or releasing a vehicle to a guest
  that is not roadworthy or is otherwise in an unsafe condition, (7) as a host,
  cancel or modify a trip to manipulate the price or potential earnings for a
  vehicle, or (8) creating or using a Caradil account that has the effect of
  circumventing Caradil’s suspension, termination, or closure of another Caradil
  account.&nbsp;<strong
    >You will pay Caradil $5,500 per breach in Liquidated Damages to compensate
    Caradil for any such conduct.</strong
  >&nbsp;This amount is not intended as a punishment for any such breach, but
  rather as a reasonable estimate where actual damages are difficult estimate
  accurately and/or prove with certainty. This liquidated damages provision is a
  fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between Caradil and you. It
  shall apply to the extent permitted by applicable law, and any aspects of it
  that are deemed unenforceable shall be severed while leaving the remainder in
  effect.
